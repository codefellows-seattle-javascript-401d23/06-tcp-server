This is a chat program with various commands that a user can type in.
The commands are @list, which lists the connected clients
@quit, which removes the current client from the list
@nickname, which replaces the current nickname of the user with the string directly after the command, and
@dm which takes the string after the command as the client to contact, and the string after that as the message

(these methods almost certainly do not work properly.. yet)
